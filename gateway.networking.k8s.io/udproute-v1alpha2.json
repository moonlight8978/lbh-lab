ReferenceGrant is\nnot applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to\ncreate a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the\nRoute.\n\nThere are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:\n\n* Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)\n* Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)\n\nThis API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent\nresources.\n\nParentRefs must be _distinct_.

In terms of fields, this means that the\n  multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must\n  be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.\n* They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,\n  each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of\n  optional fields to different values.
